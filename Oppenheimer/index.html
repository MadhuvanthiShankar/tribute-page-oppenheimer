        Julius Robert Oppenheimer (also known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb)
        was an American theoretical physicist and professor of physics. He is
        best known for his role as the scientific director of the Manhattan
        Project, which was responsible for developing the first atomic bomb
        during World War II. Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, in New York
        City, USA. He made significant contributions to the fields of quantum
        mechanics and theoretical physics, and his work had a profound impact on
        the development of modern physics.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of Oppenheimer's most notable achievements was his role in leading
        the team of scientists at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where
        they successfully designed and built the first atomic bomb. The
        successful test of the bomb took place on July 16, 1945, in a desert
        region of New Mexico, an event famously referred to as the "Trinity"
        test. After the war, Oppenheimer became an advocate for international
        control of nuclear weapons. He recognized the potential dangers of
        unrestrained nuclear proliferation and sought to prevent a nuclear arms
        race.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oppenheimer's legacy is also complex and debated due to his involvement
        in the creation of a weapon of mass destruction. Oppenheimer is one the
        most notable people in the history of the world but it is to be noted
        that his life was definitely a rollercoaster ride and he was constantly
        under false accusations which led to problems in issuing his security
        clearance even till the end of his career. A person who is capable of
        inventing something as dangerous as an atomic bomb can be considered an
        unscrupulous person but we need to keep in mind that he did put forth
        his opinion as to not use the weapons against another country and also
        expressed remorse and regret over the devastation caused by the
        bombings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oppenheimer's political beliefs and associations were a subject of
        scrutiny and controversy during his lifetime. While Oppenheimer was not
        a formal member of the Communist Party, he did have associations with
        left-leaning individuals and organizations that attracted the attention
        of government authorities during the Cold War era. It's important to
        note that Oppenheimer's political beliefs and associations were complex
        and not easily categorized. While he had connections to leftist circles,
        his primary focus was on his scientific work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, while Oppenheimer had associations with left-leaning
        individuals and organizations, whether he can be accurately
        characterized as a "communist" is a matter of interpretation and
        historical context. His legacy is marked by his contributions to
        science, his role in the development of the atomic bomb, and the ethical
        and political challenges he faced during a tumultuous period in history.

            Oppenheimer quoted the Bhagavad Gita ‘Now I am become Death, the
            destroyer of worlds.’ in a 1965 TV documentary.

            Einstein once wrote that he didn't believe in quantum physics, which
            would become Oppenheimer's field of study. The younger scientist
            later called Einstein "completely cuckoo."

            After research at other institutions, Oppenheimer joined the physics
            department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he
            became a full-time professor in 1936.
